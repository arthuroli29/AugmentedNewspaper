Here is my submission for the proposed test.

Below is a summary of the key elements that I focused on:
- Combine: Powers reactive data flow and keeps UI elements in sync with data changes.
- Async/Await: Makes asynchronous code easier to read and improves performance.
- Dependency Injection: Keeps the code modular, easy to test, and flexible.
- Custom Components: Modular views that can be reused help maintain a clean codebase.
- Error Handling: Provides a smooth, user-friendly experience by handling issues gracefully.
- Mock Testing: Allows for isolated and precise unit tests.
- Testing Concurrency: Ensures that asynchronous code runs correctly in tests.
